This example demonstrates a failure condition that occurs if list-item labels are not tagged with **Lbl**.

This failure condition occurs with both ordered and unordered lists.

If the list-item label is not tagged with **Lbl**, the label (e.g., a number) could be misunderstood as part of the item (e.g., "2 apple").
