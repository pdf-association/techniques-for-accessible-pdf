The objective of this technique is to show how to tag a list that occurs within a  paragraph of text.

In this first paragraph the **P** tag contains, in addition to paragraph text, a list of items. The **L** tag is therefore a child of the **P** tag. As the list is unordered and does not include labels, it does not include a **[ListNumbering](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#listnumbering)** attribute. 

In the second paragraph the ordered list requires a **[ListNumbering](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#listnumbering)** attribute set to *LowerRoman*.
