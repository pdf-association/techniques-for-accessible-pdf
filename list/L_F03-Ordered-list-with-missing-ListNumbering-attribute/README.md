This example demonstrates a failure condition that applies when an ordered list (numbered list) does not have a **[ListNumbering](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#listnumbering)** attribute. 

In this case, the labels for the list items are Arabic numbers, therefore the **[ListNumbering](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#listnumbering)** attribute should be set to "Decimal".

If the **[ListNumbering](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#listnumbering)** attribute is not set assistive technology may misrepresent the list item labels to the user.
