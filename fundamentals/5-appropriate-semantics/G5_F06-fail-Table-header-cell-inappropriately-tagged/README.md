This describes a failure condition in which a [heading tag](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#heading-tag) (**Hn**) is used instead of a [table header](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#table-headers) (**TH**). Headings (e.g., **H2**, **H3**) may be present in a table for the purpose of organizing the document as a whole but they must be contained in **TH** or **TD** cells.
