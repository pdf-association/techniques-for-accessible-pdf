The objective of this technique is to show how to tag [non-text content](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#non-text-content) that is intended to be consumed as text. In this example, graphics were used to place the word "paragraph" on the page, instead of text objects. To make the characters of this graphic extractable, [ActualText](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#actualtext) on a separate **Span** tag is used. The [ActualText](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#actualtext) matches the visual appearance of the related graphics.

Note:  The **Span** tag is always the recommended choice if [ActualText](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#actualtext) is required because [ActualText](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#actualtext) removes the semantics of tags. In spite of the previous statement, [ActualText](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#actualtext) may also work when the tag is one of the following: **Lbl** (outside of List structures), **P**, **BibEntry**, **BlockQuote**, **Caption**, **Code**, **Note**, **Quote**.  However, [ActualText](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#actualtext) should never be assigned to other tags.

Note: This passes PDF/UA requirements but not WCAG 1.4.5. Images of text are not allowed in WCAG.
