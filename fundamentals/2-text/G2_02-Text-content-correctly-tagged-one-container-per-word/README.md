The objective of this technique is to show how to tag [text content](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#text-content), so that it is machine-readable. In this example, each word is created in a separate [container](https://pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#Container). All of the containers that semantically belong together are contained in one **P** tag.
