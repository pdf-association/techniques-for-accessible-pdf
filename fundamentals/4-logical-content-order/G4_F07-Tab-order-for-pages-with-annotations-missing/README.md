This example demonstrates a failure condition in which the document's [tab order](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#tab-order) for [annotations](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#annotation), such as form fields, links or notes, is not set. 

Note: In the sample file, the Tab order is set to “Unspecified.” However, in Acrobat, there is a setting (in the Accessibility preferences) for “Use document structure for [tab order](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#tab-order) when no explicit [tab order](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#tab-order) is specified.” If that checkbox is checked, the sample file may display a correct [tab order](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#tab-order) by chance.
