This example demonstrates a failure condition in which the order of [content](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#c) within a [marked content sequence](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#marked-content-sequence) does not match the [authorâ€™s intent](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#authors-intent).

Often, when text is rotated, the [content order](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#content-order) within the [marked content sequence](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#marked-content-sequence) is incorrect, like in this example. Even though English is written top to bottom and left to right, the text in this example should be ordered strictly left to right.
