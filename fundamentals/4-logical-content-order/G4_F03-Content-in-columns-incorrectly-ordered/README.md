This describes a failure condition where a multicolumn document is tagged in a way that does not match the [author’s intent](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#authors-intent). Accessibility requires that [content](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#c) is tagged with a [logical content order](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#logical-content-order) that reflects the [author’s intent](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#authors-intent). In this example, the author intended columns but the [logical content order](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#logical-content-order) does not reflect columns.
