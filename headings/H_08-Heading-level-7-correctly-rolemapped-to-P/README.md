The objective of this technique is to show how to tag headings with a heading level higher than 6. 

Use a custom **Hn** tag that expresses the appropriate heading level.  [Role mapping](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#role-mapping) an **Hn** [heading tag](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#heading-tag) higher than **H6** to **H6** allows [assistive technology](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#assistive-technology) that does not support headings above **H6** to nonetheless perceive a heading. Choosing an appropriate [role mapping](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#role-mapping) is at the discretion of the author. This example shows **H7** rolemapped to **P**. [H_09](https://pdfa.org/techniques-for-accessible-pdf/heading-level-7-correctly-rolemapped-to-h6/UA1_Tpdf-H_09/) shows **H7** rolemapped to **H6**.

A simplified heading hierarchy, if appropriate to the content, is desirable. [Role mapping](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#role-mapping) an **Hn** [heading tag](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#heading-tag) higher than **H6** to **P** can help to serve this purpose.

Note: For compatibility purposes and to avoid ambiguity, custom [heading tags](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#heading-tag) must use the letter **H** followed by Arabic numerals without any spaces or punctuation. For example, **H1247** is permissible while "H1,247" and "H1 247" are not.
