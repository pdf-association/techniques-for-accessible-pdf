The objective of this technique is to show how to tag headings with a heading level higher than 6. 

Use a custom **Hn** tag that expresses the appropriate heading level. [Role mapping](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#role-mapping) an **Hn** [heading tag](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#heading-tag) higher than **H6** to **H6** allows [assistive technology](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#assistive-technology) that does not support headings above **H6** to nonetheless perceive a heading. [Role mapping](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#role-mapping) an **Hn** [heading tag](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#heading-tag) higher than **H6** to **P** could serve the purpose of simplifying the headings hierarchy. Choosing an appropriate [role mapping](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#role-mapping) is at the discretion of the author. This example shows **H7** rolemapped to **H6**. [H_08](https://pdfa.org/techniques-for-accessible-pdf/heading-level-7-correctly-rolemapped-to-p/UA1_Tpdf-H_08/) shows **H7** rolemapped to **P**.

In order to ensure that software which supports headings higher than level 6 can obtain a common understanding of the document's structure, PDF/UA requires that [heading tags](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#heading-tag) higher than 6 are defined by the letter **H** followed by Arabic numerals without any spaces or punctuation. For example, **H1247** is permissible while **H1**,247 and **H1** 247 are not.
