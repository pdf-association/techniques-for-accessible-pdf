The objective of this technique is to show how to tag a document's title and subtitle separate from the document's heading hierarchy. 

In this example, the title is tagged with a **Title** tag role mapped to **P**. The subtitle is tagged with a custom "Subtitle" tag, also role mapped to **P**.

NOTE: PDF 2.0 formalizes the **Title** tag, accordingly, reader software that supports PDF 2.0 will handle **Title** correctly without role mapping.
