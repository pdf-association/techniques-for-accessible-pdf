The objective of this technique is to show how to use [heading tags](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#heading-tag) to provide a logical heading hierarchy to facilitate non-visual access to the [content](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#content) in a document.

In order to ensure a reliably navigable document, PDF/UA-1 prohibits skipping heading levels. In this case, the tags use **H1** followed by **H2** even though the second heading visually appears to be a third-level heading.
