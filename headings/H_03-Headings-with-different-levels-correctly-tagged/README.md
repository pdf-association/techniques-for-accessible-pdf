The objective of this technique is to show how to use PDF tags to ensure that a document's structure, as expressed by its headings, is accessible.

In order to correctly mark up documents containing multiple top-level headings (e.g., a collection of articles), PDF/UA allows multiple **H1** headings. The first heading in the PDF/UA conforming file must be an **H1**, and heading levels must not be skipped.
