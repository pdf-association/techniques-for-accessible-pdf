The objective of this technique is to show how to tag the first heading in a document. 

In PDF, heading tags are not used to signify importance, rather, they represent the document's structure. As such, consistent use of heading tags makes PDF documents navigable by those using assistive technologies. 

The first heading is always tagged with **H1**. Additional H1 tags are possible if [semantically appropriate](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#semantically-appropriate) for the content, for example, chapters in a book.

Note that while the PDF format does not restrict the number of **H1** tags; PDF/UA simply requires heading tags (like all tags) to be semantically appropriate to the document's content.
