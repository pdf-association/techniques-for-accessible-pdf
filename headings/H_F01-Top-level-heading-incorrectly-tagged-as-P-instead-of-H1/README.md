This example demonstrates a failure condition in which the appearance of text indicates that the [author intends](https://pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#Authors_intent) it to be understood as a heading, but the [semantically appropriate](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#semantically-appropriate) tag is not used. 

In this case, the heading text should be marked by an **H1** tag instead of a **P** tag so that it can be recognized as a heading of level one in a non-visual way.
