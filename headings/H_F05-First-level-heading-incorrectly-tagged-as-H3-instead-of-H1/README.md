This example demonstrates a failure condition in which a change in the appearance of text indicates that the text is a heading, but the [semantically appropriate](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#semantically-appropriate) tag is not used. 

In this case, the text indicating the heading level 2 must be marked by an **H2** tag instead of a **P** tag.
