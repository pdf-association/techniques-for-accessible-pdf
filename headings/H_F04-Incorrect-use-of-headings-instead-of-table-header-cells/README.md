This example demonstrates a failure condition in which a [heading tag](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#heading-tag) (**Hn**) is used instead of a [table header](https://www.pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#table-headers) (**TH**). 

Headings (e.g., **H1**, **H2**) do not establish a relationship between table cells, however headings may be used in a table cell if the [author's intent](https://pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/#Authors_intent) is to organize the document as a whole.
